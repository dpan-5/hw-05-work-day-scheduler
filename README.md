# Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

This is a work day calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Functionality

When a user opens the application, the current date is displayed at the top. 

Time blocks are also displayed in color-coded fashion, indicating whether or not the time block is past, is present, or future. 

Users can click on a time block to enter an input and save the input by clicking the save button. The saved events will persist in the user's local storage and be displayed. 

I've also added additional functionality so that by triple-clicking a time block, a user is given a confirmation to delete the task.
